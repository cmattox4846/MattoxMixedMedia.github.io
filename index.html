        <h2>Get To Know Me</h2>

        <p><img src="home_background.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="200" id="aboutimg"/>Mattox Mixed Media is a solution that I have been developing for the last 8 years. I started my career doing computer programming in the early 2000's since then I have had many jobs and experiances in an out of the IT world. When I joined the US Air Force I began to develop my skills in IT as well as my skills as a photographer. As time went on I started to realize that if I wanted to build a all around solution I would need to combine all of the things I have learned from my private annd professional life and MattoxMixedMedia was born. Since its inception I have continue to bring new services and skills to the table. I now am a certifed fullstack developer, photographer, drone pilot and all around IT enthusiest. <br> Everyday I am looking to continue my learning and broaden my skills in order to stay update on the new technolgies. I have a passion for IT and I think that if you can find that thing inn life that give you joy then you should jump on the train and riding until the tracks end. </p>
